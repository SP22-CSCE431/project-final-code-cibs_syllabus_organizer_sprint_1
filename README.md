## Introduction

CIBSSyllabusOrganizer is an online application that makes it easy for business students to upload their syllabi for classes they want to take abroad for approval. When a student uploads a syllabi with the corresponding information, an administrator will assign the request to a specific department for approval. The department reviewers will go through the syllabus and find the correct contact hours for the class and submit it to the administrator for approval. If the student is able to take the course abroad, then the administrator will be able to approve the request. Happy travels!

## Environment Variables/Files
There are certrain environment variables that need to be configured. They can be set in the `config/environments/development.rb`, or locally on the system environemt. If done locally, it will not persist when the Docker image is closed. For deployment on Heroku, the environment varibales should be set under the **Config Vars** section in the **Setting** tab of the app.

* `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
* `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`

The app uses Rails Active Storage, which is linked to Google Cloud and whose actions are performed through a service account. The `local` environment doesn't use Google Cloud, it simply performs its storage locally, however the `development` and `production` environments do use it. The service account credentials are encrypted and stored under `config/credentials`. Each encrypted credentials requires a key to be accessed. The key should be name `<environmet>.key` and stored in `config/credentials`. Example `development.key`. For deployment on Heroku, set `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` to the key found in the `production.key` file. For use in all environments the following files should be present.

* `config/credentials/production.rb`
* `config/credentials/development.rb`
* `config/credentials/test.rb`

## Execute Code Locally

First, navigate to the folder where you downladed the repository in Powershell if using Windows or the terminal if using a Mac. Once there, run the following command in order to get the docker app running:

`docker run --rm -it --volume "$(pwd):/csce431" -e DATABASE_USER=cibs_syllabus_organizer -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=test_password -p 3000:3000 dmartinez05/ruby_rails_postgresql:latest`

Next, navigate to the correct folder where your repository is located. Once there, run these following commands in order to get the app set up to run

- `bundle install`
- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`
- `rails db:seed`

Once all these commands are run, you can now run the app locally using: `rails server --binding:0.0.0.0`

The application can be seen using a browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000/
